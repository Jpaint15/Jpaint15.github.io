        <h2>Programming Languages</h2>
        <p>
            Programming languages allow us to give instructions to a computer in a way the computer will understand. <br>
            The language that a computer understands is called binary, and the process of translating programming language <br>
            to binary is known as compiling. There are many different programming languages, which each have their own<br>
            distinct features but all share common attributes. These languages allow computers to qucikly process information written <br>
            through code. We are going to talk about 4 different programming languages that will be discussed is C, Java, JavaScript, and Python.
        </p>
        <h2>Syntax</h2>
        <p>
            The syntax of a programming lanugage dsescribes which strings of characters that makeup a program. Syntax is  <br>
            important so that the programmers can write valid programs. Wtihout syntax, the semantics of a code is nearly impossible to <br>
            understand. Every language has its own set of rules that make up its basic synax. Here are some of the examples or basic syntax: <br>
            <ul>
				<li>Case Sensitive: Indentiers such as world and World have different meanings</li>
				<li>Class Names: Some languages requre that firest letter of  each word in class names be upper case</li>
				<li>Program Filenames: The name of a program file must match the class name with the extension.</li>
			</ul>
        </p>
        <h2>RAPTOR Flowchart Application</h2>
        <p>RAPTOR is a flowchart-based programming environment designed to help student visualize their algorithms without focusing <br>
            on the syntax of the program. RAPTOR programs are cretaed visually and exectuted visually by tracking the execution throught <br>
            a flowchart. Flowchart's are easier for the mind to undertand while looking at as opposed to looking at lines of code and <br>
            not being able to focus on the functionality of the program.
