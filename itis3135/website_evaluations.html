            <h2>Introuction</h2>
            <p>
                The CRAP principles are the principles of design using html code. The 4 principles are contrast, <br>
                alignment, repetition, and proximity. Contrast is the concept that different colors, shapes, and<br>
                themes to draw the reader's attention. Repetition is like consistency and readers tend to be more <br>
                invested i what their reading if they see continued patterns. Alignment control's the reader's eyes<br>
                and what their eyes go to and influences their opinion if things are clean or not. Proximity help's <br>
                organize their ewbsite by keeping similar elements near one another creating a nice flow for the website<br>

                        information at the bottom is not important and overall just is not organized because nothing goes together.
